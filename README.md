## About The Project

The program was written to rapidly calculate the water flux of hollow fiber membranes from time-mass data generated by
data-logging load cells, input values describing the properties of the membranes, and specified test conditions
including time at which the flux testing window should begin and the test pressure at the test time. The program 
converts mass to volume based on test room temperature and Kell's equation, applies data smoothing to reduce 
fluctuations in the volume data calculated from the load cells then uses changes in volume and 
properties of the membranes to calculate flux based on specified test conditions.

It currently has the following limitations and known bugs:
- The time-mass data files must be named 'Channel_0.csv', 'Channel_1.csv', etc.
- If channel data is in HH:MM:SS format then test_conditions.csv must have time in HH:MM:SS format.
- Units of inputs have limited choices and output units are set
- Pressure measurement must be recorded during the experiment manually to be included in the test conditions file.
- If there are no mass values for a specified test time the program will end and provide a descriptive error message.

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - A high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming.

## Features

- Feature 1: Reading time-mass data, inputs and test conditions from .csv files.
- Feature 2: Applying data smoothing to the mass values.
- Feature 3: Converting mass to volume
- Feature 4: Finding volume values at the start and end of the specified test windows.
- Feature 5: Calculating flux from changes in volume and membrane properties.
- Feature 6: Generating outputs.csv file from analysis results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
numpy
pandas

### Installation

Obtain access to the private GitHub project from Timothy Warner

## Usage

- Update the files membrane_properties.csv, test_conditions.csv and experiment_configuration.csv
- Data files in folder "data" have name with form Channel_i.csv where i is a sequential integer starting from 0.
- Run the python script "membrane-flux-analysis-tool.py"
- Flux data stored in outputs.csv


## Configuration

membrane_properties.csv file contains:
  - Membrane type (HF or FS). Input HF for hollow fiber membranes and FS for flat sheet membranes
  - Flat sheet area (m^2). Only utilized when flat sheet membrane is selected
  - Hollow fiber membrane length (Length (cm)). Only utilized when hollow fiber membrane is selected
  - Hollow fiber membrane outside diameter (Diameter (mm)). Only utilized when hollow fiber membrane is selected
  - Number of membranes tested simultaneously (number of membranes flowing to a single load cell)

experiment_configuration.csv file contains:
  - Number of load cells
  - Input pressure unit (bar or PSI or MPa)
  - The length of time over which the mass change will be measured for flux calculations (Test Duration (s))
  - The data interval at which the load cell collects data (Data Interval (s))
  - The temperature of the room at which the test took place (C)
  - The number of data points over which a rolling average of the data applies (Data smoothing interval (# of points))

test_conditions.csv file contains:
  - The time at which the flux measurement begins
  - The pressure over the measurement duraion

Format:

Measurement Start time (24hr time),Pressure
19:23:00, 				            19.5
18:56:00,			             	29.7
18:31:00,				            39.7
18:05:00,				            50.0


The time-mass data files must be named 'Channel_0.csv', 'Channel_1.csv', etc. and placed in the folder
'Data'. The time data column must contain a time formatted HH:MM:SS but does not matter if a date, fractional
second or additional data identifier is present or not. 

Example format:

## Roadmap

- [x] Development of minimum viable code to calculate flux based on the provided data and inputs
- [ ] Graphical user interface (GUI)
    - [ ] Modify inputs file based on GUI
    - [ ] Select data files for analysis
    - [ ] Run button for the script
- [x] Provide additional setting such as:
  - [x] Choosing between flat sheet and hollow fiber membrane
  - [x] Choosing the number of data files to read and analyse – between 1 and 9 files
  - [x] Choosing input units for pressure – metric vs imperial
- [ ] Improved functionality
    - [ ] Linear regression of flux values to calculate permeance of each data set
    - [ ] Plotting of flux vs pressure
      - [ ] Generating to copy-paste
      - [ ] Saving of image files
    - [x] Generation of useful test statistics
    - [x] Generalising the code, so it can function with different time intervals and different rolling average windows.
    - [x] Allow for the addition of pressure data logging
- [x] Quality Control
  - [x] Eliminated known bug when time values are missing from the raw data.
  - [x] Ensure the code functions as expected.
  - [x] Provide useful error messages and guide users to error free use of the software.
- [ ] Packaging of code to standalone application
    - [ ] Generate .exe so the program can be run without installing python
    - [ ] Ensure the standard of the code is high and fit to be published on GitHub and subsequent software journals including organised documentation and sufficient quality control and de-bugging
