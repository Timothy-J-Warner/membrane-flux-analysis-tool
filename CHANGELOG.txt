# Changelog

## v0.1.3

Added extra features to the code including selections for pressure input units, number of load cells,membrane
geometry and data smoothing interval. Warning messages are present that alert the user if the config.csv file is
incorrectly formatted.

Improved versatility of the code. The headings in the data files are no longer used to identify columns for creating
variables. The time is now always in the first data column and the mass is in the second column.

## v0.1.2

Implemented a conversion from measured mass to volume using Kell's equation and updated all related areas of the code

## v0.1.1

### Reading CSV Files:

Before: Each channel was read separately into different DataFrames.
After: The channels are read into a list of DataFrames using a list comprehension, reducing redundancy.
Data Extraction:

Before: Data for each channel was converted to numpy arrays separately.
After: Data extraction for each channel was combined into a single list comprehension, streamlining the process.

### Variable Allocation:

Before: Constants were assigned individually from the array.
After: Constants are unpacked directly from the array in a single line.
Rolling Average Calculation:

Before: Rolling averages were calculated using manual loops.
After: Rolling averages are calculated using Pandas' built-in rolling function, making the code more concise and
readable.

### Flux Calculation:

Before: Separate flux vectors were used for each channel.
After: A single 2D array is used for all channels, simplifying the code structure.


### Data Series Creation:

Before: Data series were created and concatenated separately.
After: Data series are combined into a dictionary and directly converted into a DataFrame.

### File Export:

Before: The DataFrame was exported without specifying the index parameter.
After: The DataFrame is exported with index=False to omit the index from the CSV file.

### Debugging

Before: Choosing an analysis time when there was a data time missing would cause the compling to fail.
After: Choosing an analysis time when there was a data time missing results in a zero value for mass at that time
and an error message describing the issue is printed.

## v0.1.0
